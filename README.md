In our analysis, we have provided the following visualizations:
### Top Starting Locations
Shows that the top locations are concentrated in a central part of NYC (lower Manhattan), with small usage in the surrounding areas.
### Checkout Times for Users
Shows that checkout times peak in the early morning hours during the week.
### Bike Utilization
Shows that most bikes are used similar amounts, with only a few used at more aggressive or higher levels.
### Trips by Weekday by Hour
Shows that early morning is a very busy time between 6-9am during the work week, and 5-6pm during the work week. During the weekends, trips are more evenly spread out.
### Checkout times by Gender
Shows make users more active in the early hours of the day, with both female and male users peaking between 4-6am. We have more male users (by a wide margin) in our data.
### User Trips By Gender By Weekday
Shows that our subscribers are most active, with both male and female users taking the most trips during the work week. For both genders we see a drop off mid-week on Wednesdays, which may need to be explored further.
### Trips by Gender by Hour
Shows early morning peaks for both female and male users (with the busiest time being 8am), and in the afternoon between 5-6 pm. On Saturday's we see usage spread out more, and significantly lower trips on Sunday than Saturday.

## Summary
Overall we have significantly more male than female users, with peak usages occuring during the work week. Peak usage also occurs during the morning and evening "rush hour" when people are likely commuting to work.

Additional visualizations that could be created include Trips by Age by Hour and by Week. to help determine if there are different age groups that are active during the day/week, which may impact the marketing of the business. In addition, Trip distance by gender vs. trip duration by gender to determine which users are travelling further and keep the bikes longer.
